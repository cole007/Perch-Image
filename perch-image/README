	Requirements:
	1) Requires ability to set .htaccess
 	2) Requires GD libraries to be enabled
 	3) Permissions to write to image folder should be appropriate (although usually required in default Perch install)
	
	Instructions: 
	1) Add the enclosed .htaccess and index.php files in the /perch/resources/ folder 
	
	
	Limitations:
	1) Currently only limited to jpg and png image formats (otherwise will throw a 404)
	2) Also pretty indiscriminate - will just crop images to specified height and width (centred along longest axis)
	3) Possibility (untested) that this method will likely leave legacy (resized) files on server when image is deleted via the CMS
