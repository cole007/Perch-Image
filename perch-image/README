	Limitations:
	1) Currently only limited to jpg and png image formats (otherwise will throw a 404)
	2) Also pretty indiscriminate - will just crop images to specified height and width (centred along longest axis)
	3) Possibility (untested) that this method will likely leave legacy (resized) files on server when image is deleted via the CMS
